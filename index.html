            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            Shams-i-Tabrīzī or Shams al-Din Mohammad (died in 1248) was a Persian Muslim, who is credited as the spiritual instructor of Mawlānā Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Balkhi, also known as Rumi. 
            He is referenced with great reverence in Rumi's poetic collection, in particular “Diwan-i Shams-i Tabrīzī” (The Works of Shams of Tabriz). 
            Tradition holds that Shams taught Rumi in Konya for many years before retiring to the city Khoy (now in West Azerbaijan Province, Iran), where he died and his buried.
            That tomb has been nominated as a World Cultural Heritage Center by UNESCO. 
            A saint by the name of Shams-i Tabrīzī is also buried at Multan in Pakistan and the tomb stone there clearly indicates it is the same Shams-i Tabrīzī, who was the spiritual mentor of Rumi of Konya, Turkey.

        <h3>Childhood and Early Life</h3>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Shams al-Din (Sun of religion) or Shams Tabrizi was born in the 1180s in Tabriz, now in Iran. He was the son of Imam Ala al-Din. From an early age, he would have mystic visions which were incomprehensible to his parents. He wrote in his autobiography that his father did not understand him at all.

                <li>
                    As a young boy, on the verge of puberty, he developed an aversion to food and starved for thirty or forty days. When offered food by his parents, he would refuse to eat it, hiding the food in his sleeves.

                <li>
                    Shams al-Din found his spiritual master in Hazrat Sheikh Abu Bakr Sallebaf. Harzat Sallebaf was a passionate Sufi master. Young Shams would often be twirled around by his teacher in the Sufi tradition of 'sama'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He also studied under Baba Kamal al-Din Jumdi. He was a highly educated man who valued the academic study of religion and not just the spiritual side of it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He was also well-versed in 'fiqh' or the study of Islamic jurisprudence. However, he would hide his education from his peers who would often wonder whether he was a scholar of the law 'faqih' or an ascetic 'faqir'
                </li>
                <li>
                    According to Rumi, Shams had a deep knowledge of alchemy, astronomy, theology, philosophy and logic. Rumi’s son Sultan Walad in his writings tells us that Shams was “a man of learning and wisdom and eloquence and composition”.
